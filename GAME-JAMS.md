# Game Jam List

List of game jams I think are neat. I will include in each:

A link to a jam, genre, theme, timeframe, and the and notes

Probably perpetually WIP since there's only like four in the list ATM. But I thought it would be good to have something to share with folks.

In case you're the sort of person like me who would care, I don't mind this list being reposted but if you do would appreciate credit.
